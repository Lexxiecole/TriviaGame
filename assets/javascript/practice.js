$("nums1").text("show", function() {

})

//my idea
var secondsleft = 15
//go reset and go// //google this

//this is from w3schools, being changed.
//15 seconds to answer each question
    //then display a losing gif,
    //AND tell user to go to the next question
}
//if user selects correct answer before timer is up, gif shows that they got the correct answer for 5 seconds,
//then the gif goes away, and the timer starts for the next question
//if the user selects the incorrect answer before the timer is up, timer pauses, and incorrect gif is shown for 5 seconds
//then the timer resumes until time runs out

//more practice
$("#qans1").on("click", function() {
    console.log("working1")
}


//check this-- it should show numbers in the box!
$(document).ready(function() {
    var secondsLeft = 15 //check this 
    $("nums1").text("show", function() {  //check this
        console.log(secondsLeft -- )
    })


    //other ideas that might work
//variables
var secsLeft = setInterval(function() {
